# Telegram-bot-weather-prediction
This project is made by HSE applied maths and informatics students Kasaeva Sabina and Sheverdov Nikita

# Overall Prewiew

This bot @Weather_prediction_FCS_bot can give you weather forecast for nearest time and also calulate it using machine learning algorythms

# Description:

While making this project our main goals were to impliment **as much as we can** features, including:

* Pandas dataframes
* Machine learning algorythms
* Python telebot
* APIs to collect and predict weather data
* Good description and decoration of project

# Problems

The main and the only problem is accuracy of prediction, which can be corrected by using different vectorisation machine

# How to run the bot

Algorythm of running is simple:

* You have to install Python 3.8 (At least)
* Create yor tokens and put them into keys.py in the main folder:
  * bot_token = Telegram bot token using @BotFather
  * owm_token = OWM key using https://pyowm.readthedocs.io/en/2.10/usage-examples-v2/weather-api-usage-examples.html
  * wwo_token = 'eb17522691384ca08f4205244212010'
* And run Telegram_bot.py
* Congrats!
