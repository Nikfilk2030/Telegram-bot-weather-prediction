# Telegram-bot-weather-prediction
This project has been made by HSE Computer Science students Kasaeva Sabina and Sheverdov Nikita

# Overall Prewiew

This bot @Weather_prediction_FCS_bot can give you weather forecast for the nearest future and can also predict it using machine learning algorythm

# Description:

While working on this project our main goal was to impliment **as much features as we can**, including:

* Pandas dataframes
* Machine learning algorythms
* Python telebot
* APIs to collect and predict weather data
* description and decoration of the project

# Problems

The main and the only problem is the accuracy of prediction, which can be corrected by using another machine learning algorythm

# How to run the bot

The algorythm of running is simple:

* Install Python 3.8 (At least)
* Create your tokens and put them into keys.py in the main folder:
  * bot_token = Telegram bot token using @BotFather
  * owm_token = OWM key using https://pyowm.readthedocs.io/en/2.10/usage-examples-v2/weather-api-usage-examples.html
  * wwo_token = WWO history weather API token https://www.worldweatheronline.com/
* Run Telegram_bot.py
* Congrats!
